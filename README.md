A Dark blue theme for BetterDiscord

---
### Important note regarding auto-updating:
Version 1.6 of the Theme should be auto-updating. Make sure your version is up to date.
If you have version 1.6 and your theme has been broken or Discord looks weird for longer than 48 hours, follow these steps:
1. Hit ``ctrl`` + ``shift`` + ``i`` to open the console
2. Switch to the ``Network`` tab on the top.
3. Tick the box next to ``Disable cache``
4. Hit F5 while focusing the network tab

The theme is normally updated as soon as I notice that something broke.

**Note: Even when caching is disabled, this issue may still occur. In such a case, just open the Network tab and hit F5. I don't know why this is happening and don't have another solution for it. If somebody knows more about this, please let me know.**
